Every college must calculate and publicly declare its COA each year.

Ranging from 300 (worst) to 850 (best), your credit score tells lenders how likely you are to pay back loans. Some, but not all, student loans require having a positive credit score.

These letters are sent whenever changes are made to federal financial aid programs, or when the Department of Education wishes to clarify, or provide guidance on any of its aid programs.","Default":"Default occurs when someone fails to pay back a loan on time.

The lower the score, the more federal financial aid the student is eligible to receive.

This is one of many factors that can go into college rankings."],["Loan Consolidation":"This is a process that involves combining multiple loans or debts into one singular loan.

There are pros and cons to loan consolidation, so be sure to weigh all options before moving forward with the process.","Loan  Servicer":"A loan servicer is any group responsible for receiving loan repayments on behalf of a bank or other financial institution that loans money. A loan servicer’s job is to get back money, but also to work with those who owe money to make paying back a loan as easy as possible.

If a student has no financial aid, then his or her net price will be the same as the school’s tuition. By federal mandate, every U.S. college and university must provide students with an online calculator to determine the net price of one year of full-time education at a particular school. These calculators are usually found within the “Financial-Aid” section of the school’s official website, but they should only be considered an estimate or guide for comparing schools as prices could still vary."],["Office of the Bursar":"An office at every college and university dedicated to clarifying all financial exchanges made between the school and its students.

The Bursar Office is also responsible for informing students and their parents of all of the school’s new financial policies or changes."],["Pay As You Earn Plan":"A student loan repayment plan with monthly repayments capped at 10 percent of one’s discretionary income.
